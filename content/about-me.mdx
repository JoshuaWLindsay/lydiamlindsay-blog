Lydia and her husband Joshua started fostering in 2020 when they took their first placement two weeks before the COVID shutdown. Since then, they have been blessed to foster 9 children in 5 separate placements. They have been licensed as a treatment foster home for their last 3 placements, caring for the most difficult to place kids in the foster system. Currently they have one adopted son and one foster daughter. Lydia has a heart for children with special needs, and especially loves working with autistic kiddos.

Lydia earned her Bachelors in Nursing from Biola University and her Masters in Public Health Nursing from the University of North Dakota. She uses her nursing skills on a regular basis to navigate the healthcare system to provide the best care for her kids. She finds it especially fulfilling to take a child who everyone has labeled a “hard kid” and help get them the appropriate tests, diagnoses, and services to start making progress towards a better quality of life.

Lydia enjoys homeschooling her two kids and taking them on adventures. Their favorite activity is getting “lost” in the woods and just enjoying nature together.
